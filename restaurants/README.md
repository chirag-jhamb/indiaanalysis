Goal- to find out which factors are relevant and by what scale for the rating of restaraunts in zomato

The "*.py" files scrapes data from zomato using [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and saves it in a csv file

The restaurant-notebook.ipynb reads the data, uses machine learning algorithm to find out the feature importance after preprocessing the data. Then uses folium library to plot the data on the map
